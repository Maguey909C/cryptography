## Cryptography
Who would have known it could be so romantic?

### Program:
1. The Caesar Cipher 
2. Future Ciphers...

### Directions (Caesar Cipher):
0. Download the encrypted text file called message.txt and move this file to a new folder on your desktop called caesar_cipher
1. Download the main.py file from this github account under the caesear_cipher folder
2. Place the main.py file in download folder into the caesar_cipher folder
3. Open a terminal window and change directories (cd) from your present working directory (pwd) to the folder caesar_cipher
   Note* cd someFolderName to enter a folder and cd .. someFolderName to get out of that folder
4. Type ls in the command line to see the main.py file in that folder
5. Type touch message.txt to create a new text file called message
7. Type touch secret.txt to create a new text file called secret
6. Type source activate cipher2 

### Determining the Key:
Solve this riddle for the key which is an integer:

What you seek 
you already know
the sum of two
will finally show
you how to solve 
the decryption key
what's in a name
one plus two = three

### Application:
You should now be ready to run the cipher program. To run the program from the command line, type the following:

#### To decrpyt a file:
python main.py message.txt decrypt key

#### To encrypt a file:
python main.py secret.txt encrypt key (or whatever new integer you want me to solve, the key changes the encryption)

### Troubleshooting
Send a screen shot of the error, and we will get it worked out.
